[MakrCave Backend Audit Issues - 2025-09-21]

1. **Exception Handling**
   - Many places (e.g., `github_service.py`, `real_analytics_service.py`, `redis_utils.py`, etc.) catch broad `Exception` and only log or print errors. This can hide bugs and make debugging harder. Use more specific exception types and always log with context.
   - Some utility code (e.g., `github_service.py`) uses `print()` for error reporting instead of proper logging. Replace with structured logging.

2. **Secrets and Sensitive Data**
   - Hardcoded default secrets (e.g., `STORE_API_KEY`, `CLIENT_SECRET`, etc.) in config files. These should be loaded from environment variables only, never defaulted to production-like values.
   - Sensitive values (API keys, SMTP credentials) are sometimes defaulted to empty strings or weak defaults. Add validation to fail fast if not set in production.

3. **Configuration Management**
   - Some configuration values (e.g., CORS origins, DB URLs) are not validated for production safety. Add stricter validation and warnings for unsafe defaults.
   - Consider centralizing all config/environment validation in one place (e.g., a startup check).

4. **Notification CRUD**
   - `crud/notifications.py` is a stub that raises at runtime. This is a major functional gap. Implement or remove endpoints that depend on notifications to avoid runtime errors.

5. **Logging**
   - Some modules use `print()` instead of logging (e.g., `github_service.py`). Ensure all error and info output uses the project logger.
   - Logging configuration is present, but not all modules use structured logging. Standardize logging usage across all modules.

6. **Database and ORM**
   - No explicit DB connection error handling in some places (e.g., `main.py` readiness check is good, but other DB access may not be robust to failures).
   - Consider adding retry logic or circuit breakers for DB and Redis connectivity in production.

7. **Security**
   - JWT and service-to-service keys are sometimes defaulted or weak. Enforce strong, random secrets in all environments except local dev.
   - Keycloak integration: ensure all tokens are validated for audience and issuer. Add tests for token validation edge cases.

8. **Testing and Stubs**
   - Some legacy or placeholder code (e.g., notification CRUD) is not covered by tests. Add tests or remove unused code.
   - No evidence of security or integration tests for critical flows (auth, payments, analytics). Add tests for these.

9. **General Code Quality**
   - Some files are very large and could be refactored for maintainability (e.g., `real_analytics_service.py`, `github_service.py`).
   - Use more type hints and docstrings for public APIs.
   - Remove unused imports and dead code.

10. **Environment and Deployment**
    - Docker and environment files should be reviewed for secrets exposure and safe defaults.
    - Ensure `.env` and other sensitive files are gitignored and not present in production images.

11. **Other**
    - Add rate limiting and abuse protection to public endpoints.
    - Ensure all external service calls (GitHub, Keycloak, SMTP, etc.) have timeouts and error handling.
    - Document all environment variables and required secrets in the README or a dedicated config guide.
