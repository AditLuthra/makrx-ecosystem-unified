## Gemini Added Memories

- The project is a large ecosystem with multiple sites (makrcave, makrx.store, makrx.events, services.makrx.store) using a single sign-on (SSO). The backend is FastAPI (Python), the frontend is React/Next.js with Tailwind CSS and Lucide React icons. It uses services like Postgres, Redis, and MinIO.
- The project is a monorepo containing multiple applications. Key applications include 'makrcave' (makerspace management), 'makrx.store' (e-commerce), 'makrx.events' (event management), 'services.makrx.store' (3D printing/laser engraving services), and 'gateway-frontend' which serves makrx.org.
- User's preference: Never remove features, always fix them. Never reduce functionality.
