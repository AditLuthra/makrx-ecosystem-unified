## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of MakrX.events seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, please send an email to [security@makrx.events](mailto:security@makrx.events) with:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Your contact information for follow-up

### What to Include

**Vulnerability Details:**
- Type of vulnerability (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, authentication bypass)
- Location of the vulnerability in the codebase
- Any special configuration required to reproduce

**Proof of Concept:**
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
- Screenshots or videos if applicable
- Sample payloads or exploit code (if safe to share)

**Impact Assessment:**
- What data could be accessed/modified
- What systems could be compromised
- Potential business impact

### Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports within:

- **24 hours**: Initial acknowledgment
- **72 hours**: Preliminary assessment
- **7 days**: Detailed response and timeline
- **30 days**: Resolution or mitigation

### Disclosure Policy

We follow coordinated disclosure principles:

1. **Report received**: We acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
2. **Investigation**: We investigate and validate the report
3. **Resolution**: We develop and test a fix
4. **Release**: We release the security fix
5. **Disclosure**: After users have had time to update, we may publicly disclose the vulnerability

### Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

**Please:**
- Give us reasonable time to fix the issue before public disclosure
- Avoid accessing or modifying data that doesn't belong to you
- Don't perform actions that could harm our users or systems
- Don't spam or flood our systems during testing

**We commit to:**
- Respond promptly to your report
- Keep you updated on our progress
- Credit you for the discovery (if desired)
- Not pursue legal action for good faith security research

## Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Keycloak Integration**: Enterprise-grade identity management
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Granular permissions system
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with proper expiration
- **Password Security**: Delegated to Keycloak with configurable policies

### Data Protection
- **Input Validation**: All user input is validated and sanitized
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries using Drizzle ORM
- **XSS Prevention**: Input sanitization and Content Security Policy
- **CSRF Protection**: Built-in CSRF tokens for state-changing operations

### Infrastructure Security
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: TLS encryption for all communications
- **Environment Isolation**: Separate development and production environments
- **Database Security**: Encrypted connections and access controls
- **Secrets Management**: Environment-based secret handling

### API Security
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and DoS attacks
- **Authentication Required**: Protected endpoints require valid authentication
- **Input Validation**: Schema-based validation for all API requests
- **Error Handling**: Secure error responses without information disclosure

### Development Security
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular security updates for dependencies
- **Code Review**: Security-focused code review process
- **Static Analysis**: Automated security scanning in CI/CD
- **Security Headers**: Proper security headers configuration

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Security
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Parameterized queries
const user = await db.select().from(users).where(eq(users.id, userId));

// ‚ùå Bad: String concatenation (vulnerable to SQL injection)
const user = await db.execute(sql`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '${userId}'`);
```

### Input Validation
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Schema validation
const schema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email().max(255),
  name: z.string().min(1).max(100),
});
const validatedData = schema.parse(input);

// ‚ùå Bad: No validation
const { email, name } = request.body;
```

### Authentication
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Proper authentication check
const user = await getAuthenticatedUser(request);
if (!user) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 });
}

// ‚ùå Bad: Trusting client-side data
const userId = request.headers.get('user-id');
```

### Error Handling
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Safe error messages
catch (error) {
  console.error('Database error:', error);
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: 'Internal server error' },
    { status: 500 }
  );
}

// ‚ùå Bad: Exposing internal details
catch (error) {
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: error.message },
    { status: 500 }
  );
}
```
